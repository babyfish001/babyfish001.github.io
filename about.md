Well, not sure what to put here. I am still on the way to understand myself and the world. 
Nevertheless, would like to share my learnings and thoughts with everyone. 

Recently,  I finished reading << A brief history of Time>>. It reminds of my life for the past ten years as a physics student. I really feel fortunate to have chosen physics as my major. Before that, I don't have much curiosity about whatsoever. It is the physics training, that leads me step by step on the road of understanding the nature, transforming me from a young adult with unrealistic romantic thoughts into a serious people with logic thinking. You know i am kidding here, don't you? From time to time, you wonder what is the meaning of life. For me, maybe understanding the nature and universe is one big part of it. 

After ten years of tough training in equations and and all kinds of experiments, I still keep a little bit of romantic gene in my DNA which I would call my love of life. I enjoy reading, talking to all kinds of people in different time and space, not interupted by the chaoic reality. I enjoy photography, recording the nature with my feelings forever. 

Maybe I will add more..To be continured
